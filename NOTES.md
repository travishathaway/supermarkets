I have reinvigorated my interest in this project and have began seeing how I could implement an analysis how close the nearest grocery store is. This time around, my focus will be Kiel and Portland.

I have already begun importing data with Open Street Maps. Through their data it was really easy to build a nice table of super markets. The next thing I need to do is start figuring out how randomly selecting residence addresses across these regions.

At the end, I plan to have two tables: supermarkets and residences. These tables will each have point data that I will connect using a service like Open Routing Service.

### Next steps

Create the "residences" table.
